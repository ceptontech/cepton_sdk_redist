Overview
========

The Cepton SDK provides the following features:

- **Networking**: Listen for sensor packets.
- **Capture Replay**: Read sensor packets from a PCAP file.
- **Parsing**: Parse sensor packets.
- **Calibration**: Apply sensor calibration.
- **Frame Accumulation**: Accumulate sensor points and detect frames.

.. note::

  Currently, the Cepton LiDAR packet formats are under active development, and are not publicly available. The SDK is required for **Parsing** and **Calibration**. All other SDK features are optional, and can be done manually by the user.

Getting Started
---------------

Below is a very simple SDK usage example. For more complete examples, see :doc:`samples`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../samples/advanced/simple.cpp
  :language: c
  :linenos:

For prototyping, it is recommended to use the high level C++ API. The C++ API also acts as reference code for C API usage. Any C++ functions that directly wrap C functions are not documented; refer to the C function documentation.

The general C SDK workflow is as follows: 

1. Initialize SDK (:any:`cepton_sdk_initialize()`). See :doc:`setup`.
2. Register point listener function (:any:`cepton_sdk_listen_image_frames`). See :doc:`points`. 
3. Wait for sensor calibration/information packets, then query sensors. See :doc:`sensors`.
4. Sleep or run replay. Callbacks will occur asynchronously.
5. Deinitialize SDK.

Packets
-------

The SDK passively listens for sensor UDP packets. There are 2 types of sensor packets:

- **Calibration/Information**: Contains sensor calibration, statistics, and other information. Published at ``~1Hz``.
- **Points**: Contains ``~100`` measurements. Published at ``~1000Hz``. 

Errors
------

Many SDK functions return :any:`CeptonSensorErrorCode`. If this is not :any:`CEPTON_SUCCESS`, then the user must call :any:`cepton_sdk_get_error()`, otherwise the SDK will complain that the error was not checked.

All sensor errors will be returned via :any:`FpCeptonSensorErrorCallback`, which is registered in :any:`cepton_sdk_initialize`. 

Timestamps
----------

All ``int64`` timestamps are microseconds since the Unix epoch (UTC). All ``float`` times (measurement period, replay time, frame length, etc.) are time differences measured in seconds. Point timestamps are based on one of the following sources (the first valid source is used):

1. GPS (NMEA + PPS)
2. PTP
3. Host PC

Sensor Fusion
-------------

See :doc:`samples/process_single`, :doc:`samples/process_multi`.

Multiple Returns
----------------

To enable multiple returns, pass the :any:`CEPTON_SDK_CONTROL_ENABLE_MULTIPLE_RETURNS` flag during initialization.

The returns are as follows:

  1. Strongest signal.
  2. Furthest signal, if it is not the strongest. Otherwise, the second strongest signal.
