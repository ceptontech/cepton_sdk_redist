Internal
========

This page provides a brief description of what goes on inside the SDK.

Packet Received
---------------

Occurs when :any:`cepton_sdk_mock_network_receive` is called.

1. If the packet is a sensor information packet:
    - Update the internal stored sensor state. This information can be queried with :any:`cepton_sdk_get_sensor_information`.
2. If the packet is a data packet:
    - If no corresponding sensor information packet has been received, ignore the data packet.
    - Compute points from packet.
    - Apply sensor calibration.
    - Add points to frame accumulator. If frame is complete, emit image frame callback.

Threads
-------

Networking Thread 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Created if :any:`CEPTON_SDK_CONTROL_DISABLE_NETWORK` is not set.

- Start listening on the UDP port (default: ``8808``).
- Push received packets on a queue for ``Thread 1``.

Networking Thread 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Created if :any:`CEPTON_SDK_CONTROL_DISABLE_NETWORK` is not set.

- Pop packets from queue. 
- Call internal version of :any:`cepton_sdk_mock_network_receive`. See ``Packet Received``.

Capture Replay Thread 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Created by :any:`cepton_sdk_capture_replay_resume`.

- While running
    - Read next packet from PCAP file.
    - Sleep to simulate realtime delays.
    - Call :any:`cepton_sdk_mock_network_receive`.

Concurrency
-----------

All SDK getter functions are thread safe, and can be called from callbacks. Other SDK functions are not guaranteed to be thread safe, and can cause deadlock if called from callbacks.

Minimal SDK
-----------

If desired, the following SDK features can be disabled in the SDK and performed manually by the user:

- Capture Replay: :doc:`samples/replay`.
- Frame Accumulation: :doc:`samples/frame`.
- Networking: :doc:`samples/network`.
